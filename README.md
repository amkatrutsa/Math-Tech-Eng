Mathematical and Technical Writing mini-course for Skoltech Independent Studies Period 2017.

Initially planned as a stand alone course on technical writing, later it has been merged for some unknown reason with 'English for PhD exam' course. So the materials adjusted to follow the linguistic path. The materials are mostly shortened and revised parts from various trust-worthy sources (see references).
